# Homebrew

Ever wondered where everything about your campaigns is stored? Yeah me too, but
fret not it is in the Homebrew, the place where all races, classes, items,
spells, conditions, actions and everything in between meet.

This part of the documentation documents the extremely volatile and
undocumented Homebrew and what it contains (hehe contains hehe).

## How is stuff stored

@SectionWIP

Alright so I don't want to dump a bunch of code in here so I'm going to compile
a diagram with all the stuffs.

## How is stuff retrieved

@NotImplemented // Wait for v0.2.0

This section will explain how the homebrew responds with data.

## How is stuff modified

@NotImplemented // Wait for v0.2.0

Supposedly explains how stuff is modified in the homebrew, I don't remeber who
asked.
