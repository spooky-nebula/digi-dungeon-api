# Digi Dungeon API

This is the API used by Digi-Dungeon for communication between servers and
clients.

This API is meant to be used to create 3rd-Party clients alike the
digi-dungeon-client (which uses this API extensively). You can add this to your
app using:

```bash
npm install digi-dungeon-api --save
```

The Documentation for this API is still being written but be sure to check on
[Documentation](/docs/README.md).

Still barebones but _Soon™️_.
